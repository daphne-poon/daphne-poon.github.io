	<ul>
		<li>I chose my own name, Daphne, at the age of 6. Apparently, I thought 'Daphne' sounded like 'dolphin' and I really liked dolphins back then.</li>
		<li>Between the ages of 3 and 18 (when I left for college), I went ice skating once a week. Unfortunately, my turns and jumps are a little rusty now, but I'm always down to teach a friend!</li>
		<li>I got a 440 on my SAT German subject test, and had the audacity to keep German on my resume afterwards. Don't worry though, it's not there anymore.</li>
