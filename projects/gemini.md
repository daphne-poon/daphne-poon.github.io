The pride and joy of my first semester at Harvey Mudd. In my Autonomous Vehicles class, my teammate and I designed, programmed and constructed two autonomous robots (named Castor and Pollux) over 45+ hours using Arduino. The goal was to play capture the flag by sending encoded signals to a series of beacons on a game board. We placed second out of over 20 teams.
