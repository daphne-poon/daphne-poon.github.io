My team of 6 is building a mid-sized robot that can navigate autonomously within the Harvey Mudd College (HMC) campus while avoiding obstacles such as pedestrians and cyclists. Inspired by many similar companies, the platform the team is developing will serve as a general platform for various possible applications (e.g. food delivery, package delivery, shuttling services, etc.). This is intended to be a long-term (spanning multiple school years) student-run project that will give students hands-on experience with the state-of-the-art in autonomous vehicle (AV) technology. Unlike other robotics projects, this project has the dual purpose to provide direct and indirect utility to the college through package delivery and publicity, helping to cement HMC as the undergraduate hub for robotics and autonomous vehicles.
