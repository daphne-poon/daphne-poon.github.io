Starting Summer 2018, LAIR has been developing an autonomous track loader. This research aims to give the loader autonomous mapping and navigation capabilities, allowing it to traverse an unmapped area and avoid obstacles. These capabilities will be extended to accommodate moving obstacles. The system is being implemented and tested on Harvey Mudd College's campus.
