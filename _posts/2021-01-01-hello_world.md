Hello! I've wanted to start a blog for a while now, but have always felt pressured to make it very technical, almost like [Conner's](https://dipaolo.xyz/blog/index.html). When I first started making this website, I saw it as a portfolio, as something for recruiters to look at, as a way to boost my application. Well, guess what? I have a job now (praying it stays that way), so I don't really care about impressing anyone anymore, which means I'm gonna do what I want and start a blog. 

Going forward, I'm gonna try and make this space more of an outlet, a medium for self-expression, a toned down version of those funky websites from the 90s. Some other reasons I'm doing this: it's a new year, and I'm trying to be more bold in 2021. I have a some time to kill before senior spring starts. Finally, I'm a chronic oversharer, and I've basically exhausted every other medium (Twitter / Rinsta / Finsta / Snapchat / journalling / calling Conner 3 times a day) at this point.

I feel like I have some fun things to share with the world, and maybe, once I get over this imposter syndrome (does that ever happen?), I'll post some technical stuff too :)

I was in large part inspired by [Jeff Kaufman](https://www.jefftk.com/), who does a mix of technical and not on his site. Would really recommend a look through if you haven't seen it before, especially his page on [donations](https://www.jefftk.com/donations), which has been super inspiring for me as someone about to enter a field with relatively high salaries!

See you around!
