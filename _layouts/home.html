                <p></span>Hi! My name is Daphne, I
                    was born and raised in Hong Kong, and moved to the US a few years ago for college. I started out in
                    engineering, but ended up switching to computer science and math when I realized I enjoyed
                    thinking about algorithms and software a lot more than building hardware and machining. Starting fall 2021,
                    I will be working at Lyft Level 5 as a software engineer.<br /> <br /> In
                    my free time, I like to do yoga, paint, and run.
                </p>
                <h2 id="timeline">Fun facts!</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>My given name is Sik Yu (悉宇). I chose my English name, Daphne, at the age of 6. According to my parents, I thought 'Daphne' sounded like 'dolphin'
                        and I <em>really</em> liked dolphins back then.
                    </li>
                    <li>Between the ages of 3 and 18 (when I left for college), I went ice skating once a week.
                        Unfortunately, my turns and jumps are a little rusty now, but I'm always down to teach a friend!
                    </li>
                    <li>My first robot ever was a lego fighting robot that I made at summer camp when I was in middle school; pretty sure it
                    got disassembled in the first round of fights.</li>
