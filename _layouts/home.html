                <p><span class="image right"><img src="assets/images/myface.png" alt="" /></span>Hi! My name is Daphne, I
                    was born and raised in Hong Kong, and moved to the US a few years ago for college. I started out as an
                    engineering major, but ended up switching to computer science and math when I realized I enjoyed
                    thinking about algorithms and software a lot more than building hardware and machining. <br /> <br /> In
                    my free time, I like to travel, bake bread, and run.

                <ul>
                    <li>I chose my own name, Daphne, at the age of 6. Apparently, I thought 'Daphne' sounded like 'dolphin'
                        and I really liked dolphins back then.</li>
                    <li>Between the ages of 3 and 18 (when I left for college), I went ice skating once a week.
                        Unfortunately, my turns and jumps are a little rusty now, but I'm always down to teach a friend!
                    </li>
                    <li>I got a 440 on my SAT German subject test, and had the audacity to keep German on my resume
                        afterwards. (It's not there anymore.)</li>
